# Create a Custom Storefront

In this tutorial, we are going to create a simple storefront for our NFT drop, **THE EGG**, by using the Treum platform combined with a React frontend.

Our storefront will have two pages:

- The front page will display all *the EGGs* for sale.
- An item page will show detailed information about *the EGG*. This is also where users can connect their wallet and make a purchase.


We will be using [**MetaMask**](https://www.metamask.io) as a wallet to interact with the site, so make sure you have [**MetaMask installed on your browser**](https://www.metamask.io/download). Follow the instructions to create a new wallet.

## The idea behind the example

This example demonstrates how you can use Treum public APIs to create an NFT drop for your organization. 

It includes `@mui/material` and its peer dependencies, including `emotion`, the default style engine in MUI v5.
