# Create a Custom Storefront

In this tutorial, we are going to create a simple storefront for our NFT drop, **THE EGG**, by using the ConsenSys NFT platform combined with a React frontend.

Our storefront will have two pages:

- The front page will display all *the EGGs* for sale.
- An item page will show detailed information about *the EGG*. This is also where users can connect their wallet and make a purchase.


We will be using [**MetaMask**](https://www.metamask.io) as a wallet to interact with the site, so make sure you have [**MetaMask installed on your browser**](https://www.metamask.io/download). Follow the instructions to create a new wallet.

## The idea behind the example

This example demonstrates how you can use ConsenSys NFT APIs to create an NFT drop for your organization. 

For detailed technical description of the platform, check out the official [**ConsenSys NFT documentation**](https://consensys.net/docs/consensys-nft/en/latest/).

It includes `@mui/material` and its peer dependencies, including `emotion`, the default style engine in MUI v5.
