# Run an Auction

In this tutorial, we are going to demonstrate how to run an English auction with the ConsenSys NFT platform.

Like the tutorial before, we will create a custom React app to showcase using ConsenSys NFT endpoints. This time, we will launch an Auction page where users can bid on the collectible you created.  

We will be using [**MetaMask**](https://www.metamask.io) as a wallet to interact with the site, so make sure you have [**MetaMask installed on your browser**](https://www.metamask.io/download). Follow the instructions to create a new wallet.

## The idea behind the example

This example demonstrates how you can use ConsenSys NFT APIs to run an English Auction for your organization. 

For detailed technical description of the platform, check out the official [**ConsenSys NFT documentation**](https://consensys.net/docs/consensys-nft/en/latest/).

It includes `@mui/material` and its peer dependencies, including `emotion`, the default style engine in MUI v5.
